IN THESE JURISDICTIONS, ZENDESK’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>
                                    <p>12. INDEMNIFICATION</p>
                                    <p>12.1&nbsp;Zendesk will indemnify and hold You harmless, from and against any claim against You by reason of Your use of the Service as permitted hereunder, brought by a third party alleging that the Service infringes or misappropriates a third party’s valid patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret (an “IP Claim”). Zendesk shall, at its expense, defend such IP Claim and pay damages finally awarded against You in connection therewith, including the reasonable fees and expenses of the attorneys engaged by Zendesk for such defense, provided that (a) You promptly notify Zendesk of the threat or notice of such IP Claim; (b) Zendesk will have the sole and exclusive control and authority to select defense attorneys, defend and/or settle any such IP Claim; and (c) You fully cooperate with Zendesk in connection therewith. If use of the Services by You, Agents or End Users has become, or in Zendesk’s opinion is likely to become, the subject of any such IP Claim, Zendesk may at its option and expense (a) procure for You the right to continue using the Service as set forth hereunder; (b) replace or modify the Service to make it non-infringing; or (c) if options (a) or (b) are not commercially and reasonably practicable as determined by Zendesk, terminate Your subscription to the Services and repay You, on a pro-rated basis, any Subscription Charges previously paid to Zendesk for the corresponding unused portion of Your Subscription Term. Zendesk will have no liability or obligation under this Section 12.1 with respect to any IP Claim if such claim is caused in whole or in part by (i) compliance with designs, data, instructions or specifications provided by You; (ii) modification of the Service by anyone other than Zendesk; or (iii) the combination, operation or use of the Services with other hardware or software where the Services would not by itself be infringing.</p>
                                    <p>The provisions of this Section 12.1 state the sole, exclusive and entire liability of Zendesk to You and constitute Your sole remedy with respect to an IP Claim brought by reason of access to or use of the Service by You, Agents or End Users.</p>
                                    <p>12.2&nbsp;&nbsp;You will indemnify and hold Zendesk harmless against any claim brought by a third party against Zendesk arising from or related to use of the Service by You, Agents or End Users in breach of these Terms or matters which You have expressly agreed to be responsible pursuant to these Terms; provided that Zendesk promptly notifies You of the threat or notice of such a claim.</p>
                                    <p>13. ASSIGNMENT; ENTIRE AGREEMENT; REVISIONS</p>
                                    <p>13.1&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, assign all or any part of these Terms or Your rights under these Terms or delegate performance of Your duties under these Terms without Zendesk’s prior consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. We may, without Your consent, assign Our agreement with You to any member of the Zendesk Group or in connection with any merger or change of control of Zendesk or the sale of all or substantially all of Our assets provided that any such successor agrees to fulfill its obligations pursuant to these Terms. Subject to the foregoing restrictions, these Terms will be fully binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.</p>
                                    <p>13.2&nbsp; These Terms, together with any Form(s), constitute the entire agreement, and supersede any and all prior agreements between You and Zendesk with regard to the subject matter hereof.&nbsp; These Terms and any Form(s) shall apply in lieu of the terms or conditions in any purchase order or other order documentation You or any Entity which You represent provides (all such terms or conditions being null and void), and, except as expressly stated herein, there are no other agreements, representations, warranties, or commitments which may be relied upon by either party with respect to the subject matter hereof.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the foregoing, additional terms may apply to certain features or functionality Zendesk offers through the Services (the “Additional Terms”).&nbsp; In those instances, Zendesk will notify You of such Additional Terms prior to the activation of these features or functionality and the activation of these features or functionality in Your Account will be considered acceptance of the Additional Terms.&nbsp; All such Additional Terms will be considered incorporated into these Terms when You or any Agent authorized as an administrator in Your Account activate the feature or functionality.&nbsp; Where there is a conflict between these Terms and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control.</p>
                                    <p>13.3&nbsp; We may amend these Terms from time to time, in which case the new Terms will supersede prior versions. We will notify You not less than ten (10) days prior to the effective date of any such amendment and Your continued use of the Service following the effective date of any such amendment may be relied upon by Zendesk as Your consent to any such amendment.&nbsp; Zendesk’s failure to enforce at any time any provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that provision or of any other provision of the Terms.</p>
                                    <p>14. SEVERABILITY</p>
                                    <p>If any provision in these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as to best accomplish the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain in effect.</p>
                                    <p>15. EXPORT COMPLIANCE AND USE RESTRICTIONS</p>

                                    <p>The parties are independent contractors. These Terms do not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship among the parties.</p>
                                    <p>17. SURVIVAL</p>
                                    <p>Sections 1, 3, 4 and 9-19 shall survive any termination of our agreement with respect to use of the Service by You, Agents or End Users.&nbsp; Termination of such agreement shall not limit Your or Zendesk’s liability for obligations accrued as of or prior to such termination or for any breach of these Terms.</p>
                                    <p>18. CONTRACTING PARTY</p>
                                    <p>Payments made by credit card, debit card or certain other payment instruments are billed and processed by Zendesk if denominated in U.S. dollars and by Zendesk International Ltd. if denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar.&nbsp; To the extent that any such entity billing or processing this transaction (the “Billing Entity”) is not Zendesk, the Billing Entity is acting solely as a billing and processing agent for and on behalf of Zendesk and shall not be construed to be providing the Service. You are contracting with and the Service is provided and delivered by Zendesk.</p>
